function -> well defined program to do specific task (code for repetiton of task)
object -> real world entity

function inside a object is called method

How to create object?
-> factory function 
-> constructor function

Dynamic nature of objects -> after creation of object we can add or remove any property

constructor property -> function is also an object(we can access some properties or method using dot operator) and every function is having its own constructor

Types in JS 
-> Primitive or Value Types (Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null)
-> Reference types or objects ((functions, objects, arrays)all are object)

difference in primitive types and Reference types 
-> in case of primitive type if a = 10, b = a then copy of value of a is passed in b
-> in case of reference type if a = {value: 10}, b = a then address of a is passed b will point same memory location as of a
-> Primitive are copied by their value , Refrences are copied by their address/ refrences

Iterating through objects: for-in-loop
Iterating through iterables(arrays,maps): for-of-loop

Object Cloning
-> Iteration
-> Assign
-> Spread

Garbage collection 
-> find variable and constant which are not in use and it deallocate memory of that automatically
-> we have no control on garbage collector (run in background)
