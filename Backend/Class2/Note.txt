-> open terminal (cd Class2)
-> npm init -y
-> npm install express
-> create file index.js write code for creating server
-> node index.js (start server)

-> install nodemon (npm i nodemon)
-> go to package.json and inside script remove tests and add start as node index.js and dev as nodemon index.js
-> now we can write (npm run start) or (npm run dev) to start the server

-> make folder structure for increase redability (folders -> config, controllers, models, routes) and a .env file
-> add port number and database url inside .env file
-> inside config folder, make file database.js then install mongoose inside Class2 (npm i mongoose) now write code in database.js for connecting node js with database
-> install .env library inside Class2 (npm i dotenv) then require it in database.js (require("dotenv").config())
-> then export it (module.exports = dbConnect)

-> inside models folder create file Todo.js and define schema(schema is description of data) in it then export (module.exports = mongoose.model("Todo", todoSchema);)

-> inside controllers folder, create new file createTodo.js

-> inside routes folder, create todos.js and define route inside it

-> now start the server (npm run dev)

-> go to mongodb compass and check whether database created or not
-> as database created (now to insert data), open postman (new -> http -> post -> give url(http://localhost:3000/api/v1/createTodo) -> body -> raw -> json then write data then send now go to database reload then you see inserted data )

-> index.js (driver crode, server create)
-> database.js (configration for connecting with database and node js)
-> Todo.js(define schema, description and logical representation of what object contain)
-> createTodo.js (make Todo type object and insert it in database)
-> todos.js (routes, which controller is match with which path)
-> .env (Port number and database url)

-> create GET TODOS API route 
-> create file getTodo.js inside controller folder
-> import this getTodo in routes folder in todos.js then define API routes
-> now write code in getTodo.js import models/Todo then define route handler
-> go to postman first give the path of createTodo then select POST the insert value and click send
-> now select POST change the path to getTodo then send you will get the inserted data

-> GET Single Todo inside routes define getTodoById and define API route for it ("/getTodos/id") 
->exports.getTodoById inside getTodo.js
-> now select GET and send url with id of any stored database data, you will see the whole that with that id

-> updateTodo.js inside controller
-> inside routes import updateTodo and define API route for it
-> inside updateTodo first import schema form models/Todo then define route handler
-> go to postman select PUT request and give url then change the data(body->row->json) and SEND

-> deleteTodo.js inside controller
-> inside routes import deleteTodo and define API route for it
-> now inside deleteTodo define route halndler
-> go to postman select request as delete and add url of deleteTodo with id then send
-> now you can see in database that todo with that id is deleted successfully
