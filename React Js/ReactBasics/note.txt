React:- Javascript library use to create user interface

React is all about component (reusable piece of code)

Inside react we follow single page application approach(one page is loaded we dynamically change it)

Why React?
-> Reusability
-> Follow Don't repeat yourself
-> Readability
-> sepration of code
-> maintainability

Steps:
-> Install node Js
-> VS code
-> Create a new folder
-> change directory to the created folder
-> npx create-react-app demoshopapp
-> move to demoshopapp
-> npm start

way 2 -> use Replit online

package.json -> file in which all dependencies, script and versions is listed
index.js(entry point) -> first js file to execute when page is reloaded
src -> app.js(), index.js(first file to execute, here react create own root for that it fetch root element from index.html, root element render app component), index.css(css configuration for index.js)
public -> index.html (root element)

JSX(Javascript XML) -> HTML code inside Javascript

npm start (convert react code in equivalent html and javascript code which browser can understand)

props.chlidren (by default anything in my component tag is not visible to make it visible we use props.children in return tag of component file)
